This python file should work in Windows (not complete as of yet -- August 9 2020).
It scans my "My Documents" folder for new files, and renames them according for the 'name schema'.
The name schema is given from a prompt at program start. Right now it is just a string, which attached a count number
at the end. In the future, I hope to make this involve OCR to find titles and dates to make that the name, but that
sounds pretty complicated for now.
After spending 15 minutes (900 seconds) idle, the program will exit gracefully
