This python file should work in Windows 

It scans my a folder for new files, and renames them according to the 'name schema', and moves to them another folder 

The defaults are "My Documents" and "Scanned Documents" inside of My Documents.


The name schema is given from a prompt at program start. Right now it is just a string, which attached a count number
at the end. 

In the future, I hope to make this involve OCR to find titles and dates to make that the name.

After spending 15 minutes (900 seconds) idle, the program should exit gracefully [I haven't tested this feature! 2020-08-18]

-----------------------------------
Notes:
To run from tvpc: open Anaconda Powershell Prompt in Administrator mode
navigate to the automatic document scanner folder 
type:
$python ./PicpyScan.py
after it pulls up, hit enter a few times until it says waiting on document or something like that

my new plan is to scan all the documents, then make a python script to rename them (after moving them to a folder) that way.
